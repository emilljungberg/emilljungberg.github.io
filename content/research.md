My work is centered around development of novel acquisition and analysis methods for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In particular, I've focused on three main topics: myelin imaging, silent MRI with ZTE, and low-field MRI. 

This page will soon be updated with more information about my research topics.
